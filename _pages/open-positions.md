I am actively looking for 1-2 PhD students. The minimum requirement is knowledge in quantum mechanics and/or quantum information. An ideal candidate would have the following skills as bonuses:
  * Knowledge in quantum optics or other branches of theoretical physics
  * Knowledge in abstract algebra, topology, group representation theory, or similar areas
  * Experience in classical algorithm design and implementation in C/C++ or Python

Please contact me via email if you are interested. Before contacting me, you are encouraged to take a glance at the following materials to learn about quantum error correction and fault tolerance:
  * Barbara M. Terhal, Quantum error correction for quantum memories, Rev. Mod. Phys. 87, 307 (2015), [arXiv:1302.3428](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3428)
  * Dan Browne, [Lectures on topological codes and quantum computation](https://sites.google.com/site/danbrowneucl/teaching/lectures-on-topological-codes-and-quantum-computation)
  * Daniel Gottesman, [An introduction to quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2557)
  * Steven Girvin, [Introduction to quantum error correction and fault tolerance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08894)
